                       <h4>A Short Questionnaire</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-left">To analyze the current gadget insurance market and determine what customers might be looking for when they insure their devices, InsurePeople carried out a small survey. The following responses were collected from 26 participants over a 5 day period.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Quick Results</h5>
                        <ul class="pinktext">
                            <li>iPhones and Smartphones are the most popular gadgets</li>
                            <li>Followed by a majority with iPads and Tablet while laptops were owned by just over half the respondents</li>
                            <li>iPods or MP3 players were the next popular gadget with Wireless headphones being owned by around a quarter of respondents </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>A larger amount of respondents valued their total gadget worth between £400-£999 than those who estimated over £1000</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Only a minority of respondents currently have insurance on their Apple devices</li>

                            <li>Interestingly the majority of respondents who insure their gadgets stated that it was covered under their contents policy</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Around half of respondents claimed they had never previously damaged or lost a device</li>
                            <li>With more claiming that insurance for gadgets was overpriced</li>
                            <li>Followed closely by respondents claiming insurance required too much paperwork and insurance brokers being too untrustworthy</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>The majority of respondents would only consider insuring their gadgets if the device value was expensive</li>
                            <br>                       
                        </ul>
                        <h5>In Depth Analysis</h5>
                        <p  class="text-left">
                            Intrestingly, many respondants thought their devices are insured through their contents insurance but despite this, many policies do not cover mobile devices (such as phones and tablets) very robustly and might not pay out for common gadget problems such as accidental damage or theft outside of the property. Claiming for individual items through contents insurance may also be expensive depending on premiums and no-claims bonuses. Customers require readily avaiable coverage that ensures their gadgets are protected against the perils of modern living.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                             The most important consideration for respondents was the price of insurance, with convience and user experience following closely behind. This has directed InsurePeople to design our service around allowing customers to rapidly and easily insure their gadgets at low prices.

                        <h4>How To Market in the Modern Day</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p class="text-left">
                           Years of marketing development has given modern advertisers an arsenal of techniques to get their products and services noticed by customers but the rapid pace of techinical development and social adaption to modern electronics has resulted in a constant need to analyse and reflect on what works and what has been left behind by consumer behaviours. Before marketing InsurePeople far and wide, it was important to assess the best and worst of modern marketing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>TV Advertising</u>
                        <br>
                            Once the go to for ensuring your name is at the forefront of the public view, reliable and high-speed internet along with on-demand and catch-up services have significantly changed the impact of TV adverts. With more people using online TV and Film services than ever before, every moment of viable advert air time is expensively fought over while online advertising is severly limited in comparison with most shows being watched without as single advery played. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            Despite the changes in how shows are viewed (especially noticable among younger individuals), Television still offers an avenue of contact to the majority of customers in the UK with most people watching TV at least once a week.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>Social Media</u>
                        <br>
                            One of the newest platforms available to reach a large number of people, social media allows marketers to engage with effectively with far more individuals than traditional adverts. If Facebook was a country, it would be the third largest in the World with a population of over a billion people! 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                            Using social media not only provides access to a huge market that can be reduced down specifically to those who need or use your product or service but it provides oppurtunity to gather feedback directly from your customers  as well as address their concerns and demonstrate to them the value of your company. Having an online presence also allows for easy sharing of your brand from your happy customers to potential new customers. Balancing your brand is important however, as different people expect to see very different handling from your online accounts and personas that appeal to some can put others off your company.

                        <u>Search Engine Optimisation</u>
                        <br>
                            SEO is another new tool in marketing that refers to adjusting your website to ensure it meets search engine criteria and allows your brand to not only be displayed when associated terms are searched for but improve the 'ranking' (position in search results) so your are more easily seen. Unfortunately, SEO takes time to have a noticeble effect and optimisation is not just a one time event but something that must be continuing worked towards to ensure rankings are consistently high.

                       <h4>How Many Insured Devices Are There?</h4>
                       <p class="text-left">
                       <br>
                       An important question for any new gadget insurance is how many devices are already insured in the market?
                       <br>

                       <br>
                       According to Flurry analytics (2015) there are 82.8 million smart devices in the UK (Smartphones and tablets). As there are only 65 million people in the UK, this suggests that some individuals have more than one device, as confirmed by our survey that found most people have a smartphone while also owning a tablet or laptop. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       From market research, it would seem that around a quarter of the devices in the UK are insured.
                       <br>
                       Therefore of the 82.8 million smart devices in the market, around 20.7 million are insured.
                       <br>
                       This leaves over <strong>60 million</strong> devices in the UK with no insurance and as devices range from ~£100 to many thousands, this represents a huge risk to gadget owners.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       A study by the <strong><u>Office of National Statistics</u></strong> found that around 76% of adults own a smartphone.
                       <br>
                       With  approximately 53 million adults aged 16 and over in the UK, there are around <strong>40 million</strong> smartphones alone in Great Britain. The actual number is likely to be consideribly higher as many individuals own two, or even possible more, smartphones.  
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Looking at this market in terms of insurance, it is estimated to cost an average of £72 per annum per device, this would mean a total market value in excess of £2.8 Billion. The mean average price for smartphones is estimated to be over £400 however, meaning the total amount spent on smartphones in the UK is well over £16 Billion, demonstrating a pretty large difference between how much is spent on smartphones compared to what it would cost to insure all devices.
